    Type hint annotating the passed object.

    This function dynamically infers (i.e., computes, decides, deduces) a type
    hint sufficient for annotating (i.e., describing, matching, validating) the
    passed object.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This function explicitly guards against infinite recursion.** Notably,
    this function accepts **recursive containers** (i.e., pure-Python containers
    containing one or more items whose values self-referentially refer to the
    same containers). When passed a recursive container, this function guards
    against infinite recursion that would otherwise be induced by that container
    by instead returning a placeholder instance of the
    :class:`.BeartypeInferHintRecursion` class describing this recursion: e.g.,

    .. code-block:: python

       # Define a trivial recursive list.
       >>> recursive_list = ['this is fine', b'this is fine too, but...',]
       >>> recursive_list.append(recursive_list)

       # Infer the type hint annotating this list.
       >>> from beartype.door import infer_hint
       >>> infer_hint(recursive_list)
       ##FIXME: INSERT SANE REPR HERE, PLEASE. *sigh*

    **This function exhibits best-, average-, and worst-case** :math:`O(n)`
    **linear-time complexity** for :math:`n` the number of nested items
    transitively contained in the passed object if this object is a container.
    This differs from most of the public :mod:`beartype` API, which exhibits at
    worst worst-case amortized :math:`O(1)` constant-time complexity. Although
    this function could certainly be generalized to support that sort of
    constant-time complexity, doing so would be largely pointless. Type hint
    inference only has real-world value insofar as it accurately infers hints.
    Inference operating in :math:`O(1)` time would necessarily be inaccurate and
    thus of *no* real-world value. Inference operating in :math:`O(n)` time, on
    the other hand, accurately infers hints for even arbitrarily large
    pure-Python containers by introspecting all objects transitively reachable
    from those containers.

    **This function cannot be reasonably memoized** (e.g., via the
    :func:`beartype._util.cache.utilcachecall.callable_cached` decorator).
    Technically, this function *could* be memoized... *sorta.* Pragmatically,
    this function *cannot* be memoized. Most arbitrary objects are mutable and
    thus unhashable and thus unmemoizable. While feasible, memoizing this
    function for the small subset of arbitrary objects that are immutable would
    dramatically increase the space complexity of this function. In short,
    memoizing arbitrary objects is effectively infeasible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Arbitrary object to infer a type hint from.
    __beartype_obj_ids_seen__ : FrozenSet[int]
        **Recursion guard** (i.e., frozen set of the integers uniquely
        identifying all previously visited containers passed as the ``obj``
        parameter to some recursive parent call of this same function on the
        current call stack). If the object identifier (ID) of passed object
        already resides in this recursion guard, then that object has already
        been visited by a prior call to this function in the same call stack
        and is thus a recursive container; in that case, this function
        short-circuits infinite recursion by returning a placeholder instance of
        the :class:`.BeartypeInferHintRecursion` class describing this issue.

    Returns
    -------
    object
        Type hint inferred from the passed object.

    Warns
    -----
    BeartypeDoorInferHintRecursionWarning
        On detecting that the passed object is **recursive** (i.e.,
        self-referentially refers to itself, typically due to being a container
        containing one or more items that self-referentially refer to that same
        container).
